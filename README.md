  ## Installation
  Installation is not necessary for the everyday user. However, for developers looking to expand upon the existing codebase, all that is needed is to run "npm install from the project's directory to install the dependencies. The only dependencies used as of this project's publishing, are Express (v4.19.2) and UUID (v9.0.1).

  ## Usage
  To use this application, after accessing it in your browser, simply click "New Note" in the top right corner. Give your note a title and some text, and then click "Save Note" to save your new note to the project's database. Your saved notes will appear in the side bar for later access and editing.
